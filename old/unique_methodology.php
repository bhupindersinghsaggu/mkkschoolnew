Learning English through Drama focuses on the speaking skills in order to take the students English to the next level & boost students confidence in speaking English. To enhance students speaking skills, Crescent Public School has taken the initiative by introducing English Drama in its curriculum. Dramatisation allows each child to absorb the language in his/her own way. Using drama to teach English will also help  to improve the understanding articulation, pronunciations intonation, vocabulary & communication of students. The Drama lesson involves not only the intellect but also children's imagination & emotions. By encouraging self expression, Drama motivates children to use language confidently & creatively.</div>
