He is the first port of call for parents of that particular House.</div>

Every student is assigned to a student mentor for the first few weeks so as to familiarize with the school infrastructure, practices and ethos.<br>

It is compulsory for each tutor to take his group out for a night out as well as a day outing each term. This helps in creating a strong bond within the tutorial group.</div>
