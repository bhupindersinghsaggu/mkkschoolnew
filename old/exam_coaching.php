                        <b> 1. Leadership Case Studies</b> Students use leadership case studies to analyse and reach
                        conclusions based on the facts,
                        conflicting goals/values and the impact on people and organisations. Case studies are the
                        preferred way of
                        teaching-learning in all business schools.<br><br>
                        <b> 2. Performing Arts </b>A Recent research shows that study in music improves test scores in
                        spatial temporal reasoning in
                        young adults. We have included a musical play performance in the programme. As students perform,
                        we encourage them to be
                        imaginative and take risks.<br><br>
                        <b> 3.Communication Skills </b> Communication is an important leadership skill. We have developed a rigorous curriculum that trains participants in writing, speech, body language and presentation skills. We have also included famous speeches from well-known leaders to ensure that participants are able to analyse both content and style.<br><br>
                        <b> 4. Soft Skills:</b> This section introduces participants to behavioral skills through
                        experiential games and role plays that
                        will aid them at school and work. Soft Skills help students deal with and react positively to
                        diverse environments,
                        situations and people.<br><br>
                        <b> 5. Adventure Sports: </b>Crescent Public School has taken the initiative by introducing adventure sports to encourage our students to explore and venture the nature.
This program uses Adventure Sports like river rafting, rock climbing, rappelling and hiking to test the participants endurance, strength, leadership and team work.<br><br>
                        <b> 6. Community Service:</b> Students observe a large, diverse social milieu at the program and
                        interact with people
                        sensitively and maturely. They visit a village and participate in community service to better
                        appreciate the circle and
                        challenges of life and their roles in their communities.<br><br>
                        <b> 7. Guest Lectures:</b> Finally, Guest Lectures give participants an opportunity to observe
                        leaders who have truly made a
                        difference. Aspire brings in Motivational Speakers often from its list to inspire the
                        students.<br><br>
                        <b> 8. Life Skills</b> The school believes that Life Skills hold the key to the holistic development of every child. A life skills programme is
                        conducted to promote skills including.<br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> i. Self-awareness</li>
                            <li> ii. Assertiveness</li>
                            <li> iii. Decision making</li>

                        </ul><br>
                             Life skills training emphasizes the development of students competence, maturity, coping skills and developing a strong
                            core and developing a robust foundation to deal with lifes many challenges.
                            Orientation programmes for new students and for students who come into Senior School from the Prep Department and for
                            those who move into the senior dorms.
