Right ideas and ethics can be fostered at the right age and this foundation makes a great difference. Congenial environment and proper guidance is needed throughout one's schooling. Cultivation of good manners, etiquettes and good habits enables a child to excel in every sphere of personality building. Crescent has been   a school with a different vision since its establishment. It has been making all possible efforts to hone up the skills of the children. Its motto is to blend  traditional education with the modern trends of education. We feel proud to assert that our school has tied up with INTELLSIS to make tiny tots study without being overburdened. This programme is devised keeping in view the psychology of a child. It helps tiny tots to enjoy their childhood while learning.
