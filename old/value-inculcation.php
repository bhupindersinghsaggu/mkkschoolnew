They should have a straight spine with each vertebrae engulfed with ethics to make them a dignified human being. We also inculcate diligence, perseverance, honesty, commitment, courtesy ,valiance, Empathy, Compassion, sensitivity, Acceptance, Benevolence, Camaraderie, composure and confidence, decisiveness, Dependability, dignity, modesty and many other values of utmost importance. We have introduced Value Education as a subject from class 1 to 12th where twice a week we pay attention only to the moral code of students and tell them about the implications of adopting high moral codes. This is what makes Crescent absolutely distinctive; we pay attention to multi dimensional learning of every budding child.
