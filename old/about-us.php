                    Crescent Public School, a residential school is situated in the lush green hills of Dhauladhar at Palampur since 2003. It is well connected with the different parts of the country by road as well as by air. The school is one of the top CBSE Schools with separate hostel Facility for boys and girls in Himachal Pradesh in India. The medium of instruction is English for all classes up to XII. Besides, the pursuit of excellence is the corollary of that veneration. Standards are set steep and morale as well as determination are systematically moulded into the students to enable their achievement. We have shown extremely good results in both our class X and XII in Board examinations, where our students were placed among the top ten positions in the state. The aim of the school is not just imparting knowledge but to create character, discipline and ethics in students so that they not only excel academically but also have a heightened sense of morality. Students are made to feel connected to everything that goes on in the world- through projects, curriculum related activities like excursions, workshops, lectures, seminars etc. Teacher and student workshops are held by eminent subject experts. Counsellors and teachers work with parents to guide students identify their capabilities and potential. In the end, Crescent Public School is thankful to God for his grace that helps us to mould the Next Generation of our Nation."
