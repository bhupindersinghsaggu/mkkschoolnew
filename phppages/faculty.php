                                    "Teachers, like candles, consume themselves to light another’s path” The credentials
                                    of our teachers speak volumes of their exceptional dynamism and the passion they
                                    have for their métier. This ‘passion’ continues to pass the legacy of knowledge,
                                    wisdom and virtues to our posterity. Teachers transform ‘learners’ into ‘wizards’
                                    who render valuable contribution to humanity, at large and we, at Crescent Public
                                    School, believe in producing ‘humane’ beings who ensemble the qualities of head and
                                    heart and stand as ‘ beacon of light’ as we firmly believe “It is better to light a
                                    candle, than curse the dark”. Our teachers not only excel in their respective fields
                                    of learning but are also well-versed with the contemporary teaching strategies. The
                                    teaching methodology is student- oriented and focus is laid on personality
                                    development. Our teachers embody ‘dedication’, ‘devotion’, ‘wisdom’, and a ‘zeal’
                                    par excellence to dispel the darkness of ignorance with the light of knowledge.</p>
