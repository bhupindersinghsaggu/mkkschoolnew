                                <p> At Crescent Public School, young minds are nurtured under the tender care &
                                    supervision of skillful & well experienced teachers. Our teaching methodology seeks
                                    to broaden students horizon by engaging and challenging them through varied
                                    activities, making them successful both academically and socially. Students are also
                                    encouraged to develop questions, make choices, form opinions and reflect on their
                                    work, thus developing self-worth and an ability to assess and take ownership for
                                    their own progress. Building a sense of responsibility towards the community and
                                    environment is at the core of all academic and co-curricular activities.</p>

                                    confidence in speaking English. To enhance students speaking skills, Crescent Public
                                    School has taken the initiative by introducing English Drama in its curriculum.
                                    Dramatisation allows each child to absorb the language in his/her own way. Using
                                    drama to teach English will also help to improve the understanding articulation,
                                    pronunciations intonation, vocabulary & communication of students. The Drama lesson
                                    involves not only the intellect but also children's imagination & emotions. By
                                    encouraging self expression, Drama motivates children to use language confidently &
                                    creatively.</p>
