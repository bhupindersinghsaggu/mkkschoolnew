                                    work and no play makes Jack a dull boy." Keeping this in view, due importance is
                                    given to Sports and Games, while designing the curriculum for the students. We not
                                    only focus on Sports and Games but more attention is paid on Martial Arts etc.which
                                    break the monotony of daily routine and add spice to it and relieve the students
                                    from stress and frustration. In this way they get some time to focus on their health
                                    as well as ecstatic development. As all of us know that a sound body is must to have
                                    a sound mind. Outdoor games are the athletic or sporting games that involve physical
                                    activity and are generally played outside in the open. Generally, there is a spirit
                                    of healthy competition in outdoor games. In Crescent Public School, we abide by the
                                    same belief. We want to make our students learn the true meaning of unity and
                                    teamwork. We offer our students games like soccer, basketball, volleyball etc.</p>
