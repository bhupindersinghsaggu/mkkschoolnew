                            Students use leadership case studies to analyse and reach conclusions based on the facts,
                            conflicting goals/values and the impact on people and organisations. Case studies are the
                            preferred way of teaching-learning in all business schools.

                            research shows that study in music improves test scores in spatial temporal reasoning in
                            young adults. We have included a musical play performance in the programme. As students
                            perform, we encourage them to be imaginative and take risks.

                            Communication is an important leadership skill. We have developed a rigorous curriculum that
                            trains participants in writing, speech, body language and presentation skills. We have also
                            included famous speeches from well-known leaders to ensure that participants are able to
                            analyse both content and style.

                            introduces participants to behavioral skills through experiential games and role plays that
                            will aid them at school and work. Soft Skills help students deal with and react positively
                            to diverse environments, situations and people.
