                                    government of India to create an environment of scientific temperament, innovation,
                                    creativity amongst Indian students. It is a step towards a new India. The Govt. of
                                    India has set up the Atal Innovation Mission (AIM) under NITI Aayog.

                                    ATL is a workspace where young minds can give shape to their ideas through hands –
                                    on do – it – yourself mode and learn innovation skills. The objective of this scheme
                                    is to foster curiosity, creativity and imagination in young minds and inculcate
                                    skills such as design mindset, computational thinking, adaptive learning, physical
                                    computing etc. Young children will get a chance to work with tools and equipment to
                                    understand what, how and why aspects of STEM.
                                    ATL would contain educational and learn ‘do it yourself” kits and equipments on –
                                    science, electronics, robotics, open source microcontroller boards, sensors and 3D
                                    printers etc. It will be (ATL) a part of an advanced program where they can learn
                                    technical & soft skills, such as design, engineering, coding, problem solving &
                                    leadership. Therefore it is an attempt to create innovative space that enable the
                                    students to make anything that they can dream of: Children can channel their
                                    creative skills to engineer different and varied Robotics design system.</p>
