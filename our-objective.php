                                        <p>The chief objective of MKK School is to educate children by
                                            providing them with an ambience,which takes care of their aptitudes and
                                            interests.It gives them opportunity to develop and demonstrate their natural
                                            abilities. Our motto is "One Team One Goal" and we are an extremely close
                                            knit family with all the members working towards the common goal of
                                            development and character building of the students, so that they stand
                                            different from the crowd. A school is always blessed with the most crucial
                                            responsibility of moulding not only a child's future but indirectly the
                                            nation's future too. So,our goal is always to accept this responsibility
                                            whole heartedly and carve a niche for the bright future for our country.
